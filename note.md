## Concurrent Entanglement Routing for Quantum Networks: Model and Designs
#### 2023.01.06

#### Goal and Terminology
**safety:** it is ok to have untrusted nodes; entanglement swap doesn't let repeaters know thew data bits

**concurrent:** multiple source-destination pairs

-----------------------------

**network topology** G = <V,E,C> (V: nodes, E: edges, C: channels)

**success rate** p_c = e^(-alpha*L)

#### Time slot
1. phase 1: all nodes receive information of S-D pairs 
2. phase 2: find paths between S-D pairs (which is what QAM can simulate)
3. phase 3:
